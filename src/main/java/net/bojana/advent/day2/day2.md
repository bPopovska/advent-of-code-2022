# Day 2
https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/2

Day two puzzle is a simulation of a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors.
The goal is to calculate the score of a game and give the total score.
Part one gives the player's 1 and player's 2 hands, and part two player 1's hand and the game outcome.

I coded a solution that uses a rich object-oriented model, encapsulating the score calculation, in combination with Streams.
